# Simple REST API with Django

This project is a simple REST API built using Django, providing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for a specified resource. It aims to demonstrate the implementation of a RESTful API using Django's powerful features.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Implementations for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the specified resource.
- **Django Framework**: Utilizes the Django framework, providing robustness and scalability.
- **RESTful Design**: Follows RESTful principles for designing the API endpoints.
- **Database Integration**: Uses Django's built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with the database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-rest-api-django.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd simple-rest-api-django
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Perform database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

## Usage

To run the server, execute the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API endpoints using HTTP requests. You can use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or `Insomnia` to send requests.

The base URL for the API will be `http://localhost:8000/`.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /resource/**: Retrieve a list of all resources.
- **POST /resource/**: Create a new resource.
- **GET /resource/{id}/**: Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- **PUT /resource/{id}/**: Update a specific resource by ID.
- **DELETE /resource/{id}/**: Delete a specific resource by ID.

Replace `{id}` with the ID of the resource you want to retrieve, update, or delete.

## Configuration

You can configure various settings such as database settings, security settings, etc., in the `settings.py` file located in the `project_name` directory.
